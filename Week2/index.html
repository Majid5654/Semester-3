            it has survived not only five centuries,but also the leap into electronic typesetting
            ,remaining esentialy unchanged. It was popularized in the 1960s with the release of 
            Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop
             publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum. Contrary 
             to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of
              classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock
              , a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more
               obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the 
               cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. 
               Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of 'de Finibus Bonorum et 
               Malorum' (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC."
